How can gini be -ve?



>RESULTS
Obviously capitalism leads to inequality since capitalists get a % of the non-capitalists. If its in a hierarchy even more so.
The commodity round robin is very optimal. The most optimal is actually a complex problem. Developing trading strategies is a side issue.


>Model Doc
>Market
List of commodities
List of traders

>Commodities
have a type
Magic type for people (traders)

>Traders
have a desire for each commodity

>Desire is either lookup for basic coms
 or 50% of satifaction of trader

>Satisfaction (ie success in getting what you desire) is the currency.
Satisfaction is sum of desire for portfolio.
Capitalists get a share of satisfaction of traders they own (what does this mean? At moment they benefit from their subordinate desires?)


Note: 1 good thing is is Trader encapsulates all Trader stuff like desire for traders!
? should commodity do desireFor tho rather than Trader? Or where else should it be?
>old problem of where does the glue between objects go?

=TODO

>Change trading so Portfolios can be different sizes. Then add Capitalists w/o removing commodities
>Then can create a hierarchy of capitalists and see the flow of satisfaction.

>Introduce currency somehow so can get pricing to really watch a free market model.
>Currently capitalists get 50% of the satisfaction. More realistic would be have a flow commodities from producers to consumers.


>desire profile must be more complex for traders as much take some its value!
So desire profile must be based upon the state of the target
->move desire profile into the commodity?
so comm decides on contact?

>Would create desire profile on contact. BUT makes very difficult to recreate as order of exposer will change and so pick off different rnd #.
